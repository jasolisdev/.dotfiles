2020-04-12 16:16:13	k1ngjulien_	feelsgoodman
2020-04-12 16:16:41	mynamehere13372	I just like how lightweight it is and how nothing gets on it that I don't want... I guess
2020-04-12 16:16:44	zerostheory	sup sup!
2020-04-12 16:17:01	k1ngjulien_	tbh arch wasn't the issue, not using a de but using i3 instead was ^^
2020-04-12 16:17:18	k1ngjulien_	yeah my entire system uses less than 1gb of ram @mynamehere13372
2020-04-12 16:17:22	mynamehere13372	bspwm is really nice
2020-04-12 16:17:37	mynamehere13372	Even out of the box

2020-04-12 16:18:37	k1ngjulien_	works fine on my machine LUL
2020-04-12 16:19:19	k1ngjulien_	but that sounds more like some kind of driver issue
2020-04-12 16:19:23	mynamehere13372	also I worked out my own alacritty config... It's a lot like yours, but it feels nice to have my own =P
2020-04-12 16:19:31	zerostheory	everyone has their best way to do linux which is the beautiful thing about linux.

2020-04-12 16:20:34	zerostheory	electro swing!
2020-04-12 16:20:40	mynamehere13372	@rwxrob How big is your disk for your arch vm?

2020-04-12 16:21:21	mynamehere13372	hahaha @zerostheory
2020-04-12 16:21:22	neopeace	i find that alacritty and kitty run about the same. i use kitty personally
2020-04-12 16:21:50	moshimoshifaeriedesu	I had to dance to the titanic theme song when I was 10, end of year school bullshit.

2020-04-12 16:22:35	moshimoshifaeriedesu	dunno if they ever cared tho
2020-04-12 16:22:43	zerostheory	try b4 you buy
2020-04-12 16:23:05	mynamehere13372	Another beautiful thing about linux is that it's free @zerostheory =P
2020-04-12 16:23:16	zerostheory	true that!
2020-04-12 16:23:19	dreasertwitch	could the Gopher protocole be useful these days ?
2020-04-12 16:23:28	k1ngjulien_	@zerostheory thats pretty much what you have to do in order to be able to run a good arch setup :)
2020-04-12 16:23:44	moshimoshifaeriedesu	@dreasertwitch yeah. Might want to check the gemini project if you want tls.

2020-04-12 16:26:07	moshimoshifaeriedesu	vi is just an alias for set nocompatible

2020-04-12 19:54:00	archification	There's so many different options to get a linux shell. You could run virtualbox with linux in a vm. You could run WSL2. You could install linux on your hardware. You could run cygwin to emulate a shell on windows.
2020-04-12 19:54:08	archification	You could remote into a linux machine.

2020-04-12 19:54:54	mtheory11dim	the most effective way to get a shell is to clean your pc of the virus known as windows and install a Linux os

2020-04-12 19:56:25	archification	@matdan9 I believe WSL(2) is really just running a vm on the backend. So that could explain the hardware problems. Past that I don't know how it works much in depth.

2020-04-12 20:05:55	archification	After I was diagnosed (I believe incorrectly) with ADD, I was prescribed several drugs in series after they didn't do anything for me one at a time. Attamoxidin drug study did nothing. Aderal did nothing. Focallin-XR patch affected me quite a bit but that's because it contains dextro-amphetamine which is also the active checmical in meth-amphetamine. I'm already skinny to begin with. The loss of appetitie placed me near death on two seperate occasions.

2020-04-12 22:08:52	skooches	I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not in functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

2020-04-13 10:51:59	milezdk	sure thing. I really appreciate your stream. Fully understandable that you need to stick to the plan. I was just sharing experience with gogs. It is a go-based repo which does the same job but is more lightweight. That means I can run it on my nas in a container. Tried the same with gitlab (ruby based) and it almost killed the nas :D Anyway thanks a bunch for one of the best streams on twitch.

You have what? It. We use ´ to emphasize the letter. We use ` like in one word only 'à'. We use ^ to prolong the letter when we speak it, it's like dragging the letter. Here's a little portuguese lesson that nobody asked

2020-04-21 10:51:18	mynamehere13372	@keko34keko I was having trouble with uefi.... That's why i am using endeavor =P
2020-04-21 10:51:36	zerostheory	yeah installing with EFI is an extra few steps and headache
2020-04-21 10:51:36	the_sysop	you probaby want to have a correct hw clock so files and certs are generated with the right time
2020-04-21 10:51:42	akintouch	EFI is not that hard
2020-04-21 10:52:04	mynamehere13372	@rwxrob Really it's just arch with guided installation...
2020-04-21 10:52:07	keko34keko	@mynamehere13372 I love deepin, I` ll look endeavor
2020-04-21 10:52:37	the_sysop	I'm not familiar with Arch but I'd do an ntpdate and systohc to make sure the systems clock is correct before you start the install
2020-04-21 10:52:39	mynamehere13372	@rwxrob It let's you choose packages you want to use and all that good stuff
2020-04-21 10:52:56	akintouch	It's more a calibration than a fix but .. :D
