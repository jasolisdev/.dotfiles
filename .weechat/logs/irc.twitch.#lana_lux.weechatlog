2020-04-13 10:22:32	dethkn1ght	but you couldn't get the cure cos you don't have id to buy more sudafed
2020-04-13 10:22:45	thatmanrobin	or it's a conspiracy and the gang started the virus
2020-04-13 10:23:07	rabbit_xxxx	maybe it's a death cult
2020-04-13 10:23:16	bacondrinker	the gang is called the covid snakes
2020-04-13 10:23:21	dethkn1ght	or maybe the gang has the cure and the scientists want you to destroy their stuff so they can let the virus run its course

2020-04-13 10:24:24	kl3psydra	maybe some ppl are immune and you have to investigate why
2020-04-13 10:24:33	dethkn1ght	we are just brainstorming here there are no bad ideas

2020-04-13 10:25:43	bacondrinker	Maybe there is a genuine reason to not want to cure people? Like in v-wars where the vampires are infected by a virus and effectively become another race - so the player has to choose between curing people with this virus, and not

2020-04-13 10:35:01	thatmanrobin	@Lana_Lux thanks, yeah I've been trying to take it easy, and I think I just pulled a muscle. That looks super helpful haha! What are those called?
2020-04-13 10:35:02	felixtfd	Check out Dr. Stone anime. They build a fully working phone from nothing. That should help. Just search for: "Dr. Stone telephone roadmap" or something like this
2020-04-13 10:35:18	rabbit_xxxx	you need an antenna, power source, coil of wire (usually around a toroidal piece of iron),
2020-04-13 10:35:34	penguinpropaganda	simplest stuff would be coil of wire, a big capacitor
2020-04-13 10:35:35	peaceteddie	Oh shit Ludum is in 4 days? IM AM NOT PREPARED xI

2020-04-13 10:36:33	penguinpropaganda	you'd do the cap / wire thing to build a big morse code transmitter

2020-04-13 10:40:36	friskydev	bing "2 meter handheld", thats what people use

2020-04-13 10:40:54	matt_d_	time.. time!
2020-04-13 10:40:55	penguinpropaganda	you need a large antenna, so the old radio antenna won't work

2020-04-13 10:41:03	thatmanrobin	@FriskyDev are you specifically referring to a HAM radio? because most radios have a circuit board
2020-04-13 10:41:06	penguinpropaganda	it is a different thing than a receive antenna
2020-04-13 10:41:33	cstrachn	ysh but shirt distance transmission could work in radio antenna
2020-04-13 10:41:35	rabbit_xxxx	depends on how old
2020-04-13 10:41:36	penguinpropaganda	so that's why you want an antenna as well
2020-04-13 10:41:38	cstrachn	short
2020-04-13 10:41:39	bixxxy	im referring to Yvonne Strahowski btw LUL

2020-04-13 10:42:01	friskydev	@thatmanrobin , yeah, and I build a bunch of radios, and I have never used a circuit board to build one, I have bought tranceivers that have circuit boards in them, but you don't buy curcuit board to build them
2020-04-13 10:42:11	cstrachn	im mad already. your doing it wrong
2020-04-13 10:42:19	rabbit_xxxx	yeah

2020-04-13 10:44:51	penguinpropaganda	they used to be made out of copper wire and a paper tube

2020-04-13 10:46:43	friskydev	I would actually do something simple like: https://binged.it/3a7vLPA
2020-04-13 10:46:56	penguinpropaganda	like a big coil of wire, but you can run it down a side of building
2020-04-13 10:46:56	friskydev	that is what people use these days
2020-04-13 10:46:59	peaceteddie	For the antenna you can use tin foil!

2020-04-13 10:47:13	portaalgaming	thats how to make a fm radio

2020-04-13 10:47:18	gregoryj1117	I'm sure she wants to keep this higher level. I would just say: Transceiver, antenna and tuner

2020-04-13 11:42:51	projectaroid	I like several of the themes. Should be a fun weekend
2020-04-13 11:43:26	c0rz1	@HalcyonEnd Yeah just buy the order of videos alone and their titles, it looks like it was a good choice. Hope you continue to have fun with it. MAKE ALL THE GAMES!
2020-04-13 11:44:04	halcyonend	@c0rz1 yeah it seems really polished and the instructors seem knowledgable, it's really fun
2020-04-13 11:44:31	halcyonend	@c0rz1 it came recommended from another gamedev streamer who is learning (streaming her progress in the course)

2020-04-13 11:47:23	peaceteddie	@c0rz1 Oh, i thought you had the same opinion that i have, that if you market something at an insane price, you make it look so much cheaper when its on sale, even tho its not really worth $200 to begin with
2020-04-13 11:47:27	kami1221	So is this a VS Code Theme that actually has what appears to be neon fonts or is it just that there is something wrong with my monitor? :D
2020-04-13 11:47:31	thatmanrobin	So my game has evolved to a space game, similar to Mass Effect, KoTOR, and Outer Worlds, but I wanted to do a lot of planets, so I came up with a plan to procedurally generate terrain for the player to fly over, and interact with procedural planets via their spaceship. But still include planets you can land on, explore, do missions, etc. Anyone know of a good way to to dynamically LOD meshes?
2020-04-13 11:47:42	halcyonend	!theme
2020-04-13 11:47:42	nightbot	Lana is using VS Code with this theme: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode
2020-04-13 11:47:57	penetrat0rr	I think in NoteDisappears you should change the boolean to false
2020-04-13 11:48:13	kami1221	Cool! Thanks for that
2020-04-13 11:48:24	jks_aaron	I had no idea VS was for PC also. I already learned something new here.
2020-04-13 11:49:08	c0rz1	@peaceteddie Yes I have the same opinion

2020-04-13 11:50:26	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 haha I'm actually flying home Wednesday

2020-04-13 11:50:38	halcyonend	@jks_aaron yeah it's made by microsoft! :D
2020-04-13 11:50:46	c0rz1	@thatmanrobin So we should see you again in chat in 3 weeks or more
2020-04-13 11:50:48	pedantech	@jks_aaron considering it's a Microsoft product, it shouldn't be surprising.
2020-04-13 11:50:49	rabbit_xxxx	use VS on my gamegear :)
2020-04-13 11:50:54	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 just been super busy since I flew out, had to learn CAD in less than a week lol

2020-04-13 11:51:20	jks_aaron	I've been using a Macbook that refuses to die after 8 years. VS is the best one I've found that works on iOS. I didn't look who made it just used it and I'm pretty new to coding.

2020-04-13 11:51:34	pelonarax	Why VSCode over VS Community?
2020-04-13 11:51:47	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 my general assessment of AutoCAD is that it's possibly one of the worst 3D softwares available, so many things about it feel outdated

2020-04-13 11:54:48	attackbutton	hello
2020-04-13 11:54:48	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 yeah it's just not fun to use, half the program takes place in a console writing commands, and simple 3D features don't exist... like a hierarchy or a list of all objects in the scene, doesn't exist
2020-04-13 11:54:48	attackbutton	everyone all partnered up for ludum dare?
2020-04-13 11:54:48	peaceteddie	Nope :3

2020-04-13 11:54:53	attackbutton	do you have packages come to the door that might be infected @lanalux ?

2020-04-13 11:56:05	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 and I thought blender was bad haha (avid blender user who also hates it)
2020-04-13 11:56:45	c0rz1	@thatmanrobin does anyone who use blender actually like it. Like if they were paying money for it, would they still use it

2020-04-13 11:57:22	lemonc4ke	a lot of people loves blender
2020-04-13 11:57:33	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 yeah probably not haha, I mean MayaLT is cheap enough I switched to it recently, but half the time I still open up blender because I'm more comfortable with it now. Maya is OBVIOUSLY more user friendly
2020-04-13 11:58:00	rabbit_xxxx	I'm not sure that's true anymore honestly ^
2020-04-13 11:58:13	attackbutton	i love how if you look at something too long it makes LESS sense.
2020-04-13 11:58:16	thatmanrobin	@Rabbit_xxxx about maya?
2020-04-13 11:58:27	c0rz1	@thatmanrobin have you used 3ds max?
2020-04-13 11:58:33	thatmanrobin	@AttackButton just like saying a word over and over
2020-04-13 11:58:33	encrypted_satan	#ignored
2020-04-13 11:58:42	counterpoint0	I'm a little worried about the theme this season.
2020-04-13 11:58:46	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 I actually have not, at least not in 10+ years
2020-04-13 11:58:47	peaceteddie	@c0rz1 I have to agree with you on that one LUL Payed blender would not really be high on my list ^^

2020-04-13 11:59:03	attackbutton	@thatmanrobin i find i have to completely get away for a minute and distract to refocus
2020-04-13 11:59:48	skomarsk	@Lana_Lux how many hours do u code a day? also r u working with a game dev company or something, or just indie work?
2020-04-13 11:59:50	c0rz1	@thatmanrobin I haven't used it at all, but some people here do amazing stuff with it
2020-04-13 12:00:12	thatmanrobin	@c0rz1 that's fair, I might give it a shot now that AutoDesk is offering free traisl
2020-04-13 12:00:15	chrissx2	Wooo LD in 4 days! Who's hyped!?
2020-04-13 12:00:18	c0rz1	@peaceteddie good to know, that's what I thought
2020-04-13 12:00:19	thatmanrobin	@Rabbit_xxxx how's 3DS?
2020-04-13 12:00:21	dongsforthee	can you code for 9 hours in your game?
2020-04-13 12:00:33	lemonc4ke	3Ds is a nighmare comapred to maya and blander for me
2020-04-13 12:00:38	rabbit_xxxx	@thatmanrobin I liked it better than Maya for modeling, Maya was better for animation

2020-04-13 12:01:23	c0rz1	@thatmanrobin do it. I think @chrissx2 uses 3ds max

2020-04-13 12:42:42	c0rz1	@HalcyonEnd Oh nice, I was going into a masters program, but mainly in psychology and/or english because that's actually my main interest, not programming. But I decided to delay that for a bit. Most of the "poems" I write will have to rhyme and some a funny at least to me. Which is mainly why I write them. But there are some serious stuff too. Yes I like to laugh at my own jokes
2020-04-13 12:42:47	lethn	Does anyone here know of good 2D animation software?
2020-04-13 12:42:56	lethn	I tried Blender grease pencil but ehh
2020-04-13 12:43:09	tapir2342	spine2d
2020-04-13 12:43:10	chrissx2	spine
2020-04-13 12:43:14	lethn	Oh I have spine
2020-04-13 12:43:22	lethn	but I'm thinking more for traditional 2D drawing
2020-04-13 12:43:24	lethn	frame by frame
2020-04-13 12:43:24	penguinpropaganda	@lethn you can do 2d animation with blender
2020-04-13 12:43:24	rabbit_xxxx	:(
2020-04-13 12:43:26	c0rz1	I have spine
2020-04-13 12:43:35	friskydev	have you tried the new grease pencil in 2.8+?
2020-04-13 12:43:36	penguinpropaganda	grease pencil is amazing for cartoon / hand drawing
2020-04-13 12:43:45	lethn	I tried grease pencil
2020-04-13 12:43:48	lethn	it seemed a bit finicky
2020-04-13 12:43:57	lethn	I might need to give it a try again and see if they've changend it
2020-04-13 12:44:00	lethn	*changed
2020-04-13 12:44:08	chrissx2	photoshop then : >
2020-04-13 12:44:09	c0rz1	@HalcyonEnd I'll ping you about my game later, but it's going to be way way later. Very early still.
2020-04-13 12:44:12	lethn	I want something basic though like the photoshop timeline believe it or not lol
2020-04-13 12:44:12	simonschreibt	maybe Clip Studio Paint @Lethn
2020-04-13 12:44:13	penguinpropaganda	that's really the best one next to toon boom
2020-04-13 12:44:18	lethn	but eh
2020-04-13 12:44:23	friskydev	they updated it greatly for animation in 2.8 Blender and up
2020-04-13 12:44:28	lethn	the layer system on that is annoying for animation
2020-04-13 12:44:39	friskydev	there are specifically videos on this for 2.8
2020-04-13 12:44:45	lethn	you have to enable and disable certain layers frame by frame
2020-04-13 12:44:54	penguinpropaganda	you could get a light board, camera and some paper. . .
2020-04-13 12:44:55	lethn	I'll check it out again since I use blender anyway
2020-04-13 12:44:59	lethn	trying to make things easier
2020-04-13 12:45:04	penguinpropaganda	:-D
2020-04-13 12:45:07	lethn	@PenguinPropaganda lol that would be such a pain to scan that in :P
2020-04-13 12:45:08	rabbit_xxxx	oh well
2020-04-13 12:45:16	rabbit_xxxx	I tried
2020-04-13 12:45:20	rabbit_xxxx	:P
2020-04-13 12:45:37	lethn	I'll experiment with clip studio paint as well
2020-04-13 12:45:39	lethn	@simonschreibt thanks
2020-04-13 12:45:47	penguinpropaganda	I did some 2d in blender and it worked okay, hard part is locking the camera in for me, with 2.8 it's all set up rather simply

2020-04-13 12:46:04	friskydev	@Lethn , its not something I use, but they say they re-designed it for animation
2020-04-13 12:46:11	lethn	@PenguinPropaganda the camera is absolutely annoying
2020-04-13 12:46:20	halcyonend	aww i butt you all chat
2020-04-13 12:46:24	lethn	I will see if they fixed things up
2020-04-13 12:46:33	lethn	I haven't updated blender in awhile now I think about it
2020-04-13 12:46:33	penguinpropaganda	@Lethn honestly the new version is pretty good, it can be a PIA though, but it's free
2020-04-13 12:46:42	lethn	I love blender for everything else

2020-04-13 12:55:53	lethn	So for example what I found out correct me if I'm wrong if an object is deactivated and activated it uses rRAM?
2020-04-13 12:55:56	lethn	stuff like that
2020-04-13 12:56:16	lethn	trying to find out how much topology affects computing power
2020-04-13 12:56:29	lethn	I'll probably need to use the profiler and investigate

2020-04-13 12:58:44	lemonc4ke	but about amount of topology, its starting to not be a big of a deal nowadays, you kinda need do care morea about animation loops

2020-04-13 12:58:57	lethn	@lemonc4ke ahhh so that's what matters
2020-04-13 12:59:10	lethn	yeah I mean that's obvious for characters and the like
