2020-04-13 10:33:35	maddielearns	I mean i assume im the big idiot as well but that just might be a me thing
2020-04-13 10:35:21	maddielearns	professors have no idea what they're talking about in my experience
2020-04-13 10:36:30	maddielearns	for all the hate Java gets I really like Java
2020-04-13 10:37:45	maddielearns	Yes it is limiting in some respects and there is also a lot of boilerplate
2020-04-13 10:38:45	maddielearns	Some things I am not going to do in java directly. like no way im writing all the UI in java. Writing a language parser to handle that
2020-04-13 10:39:24	maddielearns	My UI library is custom. JavaFX is good tho
2020-04-13 10:40:01	maddielearns	it is super confusing in some respects. the TextField class gave me such a headache
2020-04-13 10:40:49	maddielearns	Well it is like shifting a window around based on the length of the text and the caret location
2020-04-13 10:42:23	maddielearns	tbh i have no idea what that means

2020-04-13 10:44:16	maddielearns	Reconstructing the data every frame sounds like it would be slow
2020-04-13 10:44:54	maddielearns	but you have to load the data every frame?
2020-04-13 10:45:47	maddielearns	I probably just dont understand but for the most part it just stores information in a class for each ui element and then updates it
2020-04-13 10:48:19	maddielearns	I mean windows will be opened and closed but I was just thinking of having a hide option for UI elements
2020-04-13 10:48:25	maddielearns	Then you just call hide on a window
2020-04-13 10:50:06	maddielearns	honestly im not sure if it will be a good idea to keep all of it in memory all at once tho. like should i re-read the UI files when u open a window or just keep them all in memory? idk

2020-04-13 10:51:25	maddielearns	My only concerned with re-reading files is speed. Like i could imagine a large UI file taking 20 milliseconds to read
2020-04-13 10:51:30	maddielearns	which idk if that will be bad
2020-04-13 10:52:00	maddielearns	I have a language that parses them
2020-04-13 10:52:24	maddielearns	What might be more efficient is to only keep the parse trees in memory

2020-04-13 10:52:51	maddielearns	Yeah the thing is trade off between memory space and speed
2020-04-13 10:54:11	maddielearns	Also do you have any idea how to write a plugin for coloring files in eclipse? Atm the files just make everything gray which is kinda hard to read

2020-04-13 10:56:35	maddielearns	It doesnt have very similar syntax at all haha

2020-04-13 11:48:02	coyotefries	seems like it works better if I get a little, like a shot
2020-04-13 11:48:09	coyotefries	but my meds interact with it kinda

2020-04-13 11:49:42	coyotefries	you can do more fancy stuff if you have unorthadox ideas
2020-04-13 11:49:46	coyotefries	for performance Im sure
2020-04-13 11:50:10	prophetltu	do you have any endgoal of this game engine. I mean when it's finished and what kind of games you can make with it ?
2020-04-13 11:50:14	coyotefries	like performance with unorthadox ideas
2020-04-13 11:50:35	coyotefries	yep

2020-04-13 11:50:58	coyotefries	not yet
2020-04-13 11:51:40	maddielearns	in my case i dont think unity even comes with what i need. Like out of the box i dont think unity has chunk rendering and terrains that map textures to colors
2020-04-13 11:51:46	prophetltu	where you can learn about Game engine architecture and stuff. Cuz if you never did that is not just that obvious what to do
2020-04-13 11:54:48	maddielearns	Unity terrain/unreal terrain expects you to use modern approaches to things like multi-texture sampling
2020-04-13 11:54:48	coyotefries	the internet
2020-04-13 11:54:48	coyotefries	XD
2020-04-13 11:54:48	coyotefries	I suggest you make a website at some point, dustin. To show people how to do this
2020-04-13 11:54:48	coyotefries	if no good resources exist, there is a need somewhat :0
2020-04-13 11:55:37	coyotefries	hopefuly the computer doesn't explode
2020-04-13 11:55:54	coyotefries	Yeah but that bits and pieces approach is a great methodology I think
2020-04-13 11:56:03	coyotefries	Im working on character stuff that way
2020-04-13 11:56:16	coyotefries	rip money
2020-04-13 11:56:47	coyotefries	Especially with 3D character building, its alot of weird intersections between art and tech
2020-04-13 11:57:00	coyotefries	there are alot of resources but specifically what you NEED isn't always clear, you have to try stuff
2020-04-13 11:57:15	prophetltu	Whats the future goal for you? Wanna be indie game developer with your own tools, or be programmer in a big company

2020-04-13 12:00:07	coyotefries	I'd like to try a 2D game engine at some point
2020-04-13 12:00:11	coyotefries	but rn, I have no time lol
2020-04-13 12:00:22	coyotefries	he is majestic
2020-04-13 12:00:35	prophetltu	Its series about how Star Citizen developers are solving bugs through out of development and alpha stage. They show bug , talk about it, then solve it. It is I think in CryEngine. And the game is huge
2020-04-13 12:00:43	maddielearns	Well I have a terrain editor built in so what is one of the reasons why
2020-04-13 12:00:58	prophetltu	is on youtube
2020-04-13 12:01:00	coyotefries	so just dealin with all the bits and shit in the output files from blender?

2020-04-13 12:01:15	maddielearns	CryEngine can make some really nice looking games

2020-04-13 12:12:54	coyotefries	: P
2020-04-13 12:13:14	coyotefries	My teacher told me once, no matter how much money or people you have
2020-04-13 12:13:18	coyotefries	you will always sacrfice
2020-04-13 12:13:20	coyotefries	always
2020-04-13 12:13:27	coyotefries	indie or AAA company
2020-04-13 12:13:34	prophetltu	especially if you wanna be Indie game developer and have no team, you should know a lot of stuff
2020-04-13 12:13:35	coyotefries	your ideas always will feel limited in some way
2020-04-13 12:14:10	coyotefries	I'd like to do that with something 2D
2020-04-13 12:14:14	maddielearns	art is just feels so different
2020-04-13 12:14:18	maddielearns	and so time consuming
2020-04-13 12:14:20	coyotefries	or attempt unity or unreal 3D
2020-04-13 12:14:26	maddielearns	I feel like there is no real way to shortcut art
2020-04-13 12:14:36	coyotefries	no there is not

2020-04-13 12:14:38	coyotefries	lol
2020-04-13 12:14:57	coyotefries	I feel most people who do both started in one
2020-04-13 12:15:03	coyotefries	for many years before learning the other
2020-04-13 12:15:15	coyotefries	learning both at once is... kinda impossible imo but im could be wrong
2020-04-13 12:15:23	prophetltu	For me it's always epic how one guy does all the programming and design and publishing, and the project tooks for example 5 years
2020-04-13 12:15:30	prophetltu	and he keeps motivation
2020-04-13 12:15:55	coyotefries	after being in film school couple years, a year feels like nothing for a project
2020-04-13 12:15:57	coyotefries	lol
2020-04-13 12:16:22	prophetltu	yeah I know, I'm working on a single project for 4 years
2020-04-13 12:16:34	prophetltu	I'm web developer
2020-04-13 12:16:59	coyotefries	lol
2020-04-13 12:17:04	coyotefries	its so pickyyyy
2020-04-13 12:17:10	coyotefries	too many browsers
2020-04-13 12:17:17	prophetltu	but it was always a dream for me to be in game industry
2020-04-13 12:17:28	prophetltu	like indie developer
2020-04-13 12:17:41	prophetltu	I'm working at strartup called whatagraph.com
2020-04-13 12:17:52	maddielearns	if u dont have a boss u can do stuff ur way
2020-04-13 12:18:01	coyotefries	Im stubborn and stupid so I force myself to do art professsionally XD
2020-04-13 12:18:07	coyotefries	I feel like theres nothing else r me
2020-04-13 12:18:10	coyotefries	for*
2020-04-13 12:18:14	maddielearns	and dont have to think ur boss is an idiot for the way he wants to do things
2020-04-13 12:18:35	prophetltu	yeah, we have an web app to build social reports
2020-04-13 12:18:38	coyotefries	yes
2020-04-13 12:18:45	prophetltu	but it's not as fun as games
2020-04-13 12:18:51	coyotefries	yesI call my brain an idiot
2020-04-13 12:18:55	coyotefries	on a regular basis
2020-04-13 12:18:56	maddielearns	Well I'm okay with calling myself an idiot because ill listen to myself a change things
2020-04-13 12:19:04	prophetltu	I stuck in tutorial purgatory
2020-04-13 12:19:27	coyotefries	yep
2020-04-13 12:19:42	coyotefries	I find that you have to do something harder alot to be better at the eiaser thing and level up
2020-04-13 12:20:10	coyotefries	or trying something and you dont know what you're doing
2020-04-13 12:20:14	coyotefries	deviate
2020-04-13 12:20:22	coyotefries	you will fail but thats how you learn the most
2020-04-13 12:21:51	prophetltu	I guess for me Unity would be enough. For things that I would like to achieve and create. I'm probably always will be a web developer for my main income. I like and i's interesting, but I always was a gamer. And it feels so close now to create some
2020-04-13 12:22:14	coyotefries	unity is hella powerful
2020-04-13 12:22:20	coyotefries	as long as you customize things enough
2020-04-13 12:22:29	coyotefries	its a tool really
2020-04-13 12:22:53	coyotefries	idk either way, Ive not spent enough time in engines
2020-04-13 12:23:03	coyotefries	im always burried in art till my eyes bleed
2020-04-13 12:23:08	prophetltu	great games are made with Unity

2020-04-13 12:23:22	prophetltu	ones that made huge amount of money
2020-04-13 12:23:40	coyotefries	YESS
2020-04-13 12:23:42	coyotefries	ikr
2020-04-13 12:23:49	prophetltu	Yeah I agreee
2020-04-13 12:23:56	coyotefries	the graphical look is all the same with unreal cuz they use the stock shaders probably
2020-04-13 12:24:07	coyotefries	but its a poweful engine
2020-04-13 12:24:36	coyotefries	personally, I kinda like unity's simpler building graound up flow
2020-04-13 12:24:44	coyotefries	uniity feels more like blender
2020-04-13 12:24:47	coyotefries	or a 3D program
2020-04-13 12:24:56	coyotefries	lot of buttosn to click
2020-04-13 12:24:58	coyotefries	ALOT
2020-04-13 12:25:26	coyotefries	sweet
2020-04-13 12:25:41	coyotefries	I dont mind complicated interfaces
2020-04-13 12:25:51	coyotefries	but more so, I'd rather type code than blue prints
2020-04-13 12:26:08	coyotefries	also my mac hates it so
2020-04-13 12:26:10	coyotefries	XD
2020-04-13 12:27:46	coyotefries	A pointer is basically like a thing tying nodes togeher
2020-04-13 12:27:53	coyotefries	like a string
2020-04-13 12:27:55	coyotefries	or wire
2020-04-13 12:28:01	coyotefries	I finally get that
2020-04-13 12:28:02	coyotefries	XD
2020-04-13 12:28:09	coyotefries	NO ONE CALLS IT THAT
2020-04-13 12:28:15	coyotefries	Like no one said a pointer is like a wire
2020-04-13 12:28:23	coyotefries	pointer a wire
2020-04-13 12:28:46	coyotefries	like teleporting sometimes?
