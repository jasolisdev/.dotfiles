This weekend was really a drag to get through. I was working alone with technical issues on a Bright Sunny weekend and sleep deprived.

2020-04-13 12:22:20	journeystarted	A profession councilor told me life was not for me. Takeaway, I am not perfect. I am multi dimensional imperfect individual. I have even taken heart in that when everything appears a disaster, I believe the real issue is my outlook and just setting myself up for feeling more positive will resolve my issues.
