2020-05-12 17:01:23	moobot	You can get the book Elm in Action from https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action?a_aid=chiroptical&a_bid=b15edc5c and see the code on https://github.com/chiroptical/elm-in-action
2020-05-12 17:02:30	freeman42x	@chiroptical your voice is actually soothing hehe - so I will not get tired any time soon of listening to you. I wish I had a voice sounding more like yours. Mine sounds like strangling a cow xD

2020-05-12 17:05:45	freeman42x	to put it another way, your voice sounds calmer than mine, I sound more aggressive
2020-05-12 17:06:02	freeman42x	can blame it on not being my native language haha xD
2020-05-12 17:06:16	freeman42x	try talking like Samuel L Jackson! xD
2020-05-12 17:07:26	freeman42x	@chiroptical so what you are doing now is actually using Elm... language or what? or is it like Haskell Miso?
2020-05-12 17:07:26	moobot	It is time to take a drink!

2020-05-12 17:11:38	freeman42x	@chiroptical have you seen the Atom dev setup using the plugin REPL ? that works so well
2020-05-12 17:12:06	freeman42x	:( that makes me sad

2020-05-12 17:12:22	freeman42x	I agree that Atom is built on bad tech
2020-05-12 17:12:23	lumie1337	i actually like atom in principle, but its slow
2020-05-12 17:12:30	lumie1337	vscode is soo much faster
2020-05-12 17:12:31	freeman42x	but using it works great for Haskell dev
2020-05-12 17:12:50	freeman42x	VSCode does not have an embedded REPL thogh
2020-05-12 17:12:59	freeman42x	otherwise I would use VSCode tbh
2020-05-12 17:13:14	freeman42x	VSCode has nice integration with GHCID though
2020-05-12 17:13:15	lumie1337	well you can make yourself a repl for it
2020-05-12 17:13:26	freeman42x	@Lumie1337 too much trouble
2020-05-12 17:13:37	freeman42x	first I need to finish work on Haskell editor setup project
2020-05-12 17:14:10	freeman42x	proper integration is way better than just running a terminal to the side
2020-05-12 17:14:44	lumie1337	yea the thing is that the stability and such comes from the fact that vscode has stuff isolated in webworkers and such whereas afaik atom doesn't bother
2020-05-12 17:15:15	freeman42x	what is page? baby don't hurt me
2020-05-12 17:17:03	freeman42x	I need to write a video just to show how powerful Atom + the extension REPL can be
2020-05-12 17:18:11	freeman42x	I can, just need to find the time :(
2020-05-12 17:18:21	freeman42x	got an endlessly increasing to do list
2020-05-12 17:18:40	lumie1337	its actually interesting, Atom is more like emacs, vscode more like vim with regards to customisability actually
2020-05-12 17:19:48	lumie1337	you can customise the visuals much more easily in Atom, plugins are more powerful, whereas in vscode you go through an api and have a few stable options that control everything
2020-05-12 17:20:04	lumie1337	kind of like vim being super stable, emacs being super flexible
2020-05-12 17:21:06	lumie1337	so yea Atom makes a better operating system probably vs. vs code makes a better editor that just straight up gets the job done

2020-05-12 17:30:31	countoren	will be coming and going most probably
2020-05-12 17:30:41	countoren	but good to see you streaming
2020-05-12 17:31:24	countoren	i wonder can you start compare betwen elm and purescript?
2020-05-12 17:32:00	countoren	i knew that
2020-05-12 17:32:02	countoren	:)
2020-05-12 17:32:04	lumie1337	purescript is simply a much more powerful language
2020-05-12 17:32:08	-->	thedevilisob (thedevilisob@thedevilisob.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #chiroptical
2020-05-12 17:32:11	countoren	i was thinking the same
2020-05-12 17:32:28	lumie1337	well if the language is powerful people are more likely to take advantage of that
2020-05-12 17:32:29	wizardstick	purescript didn't work well on nixos for me, so i dumped it for elm and loved it
2020-05-12 17:33:06	lumie1337	it really depends on what you want to do. if your use case is complicated it may make sense
2020-05-12 17:33:24	countoren	purescript does not build in nixos?
2020-05-12 17:33:32	lumie1337	purescript works fine for me with nix
2020-05-12 17:33:35	wizardstick	it's hard to get the dependencies with nixos
2020-05-12 17:35:09	wizardstick	I wish I had a vim setup like you do, I don't think I found anything with the auto-complete
2020-05-12 17:35:19	wizardstick	I need it for haskell too

2020-05-12 17:39:02	lumie1337	so no interfaces effectively

2020-05-12 17:39:31	piq9117	yeah coz i think the creators of halogen are are veteran haskellers
2020-05-12 17:39:51	lumie1337	in practice it means you need to do alot more manual wiring in elm
2020-05-12 17:40:01	lumie1337	and the architecture is more "rigid"

2020-05-12 17:40:22	countoren	i think it is just different philosophy I can find use cases for elm.
2020-05-12 17:40:24	piq9117	yeah. once ur used to the purs type system it gets easier
2020-05-12 17:40:40	wizardstick	is your neovim init file primed for haskell as well?
2020-05-12 17:41:23	lumie1337	but there are other differences between purescript and elm, e.g. purescript is modular, elm includes a bundler and isn't fully modular
2020-05-12 17:41:45	lumie1337	purescript has straight up translation to js, whereas elm is opaque
2020-05-12 17:41:57	lumie1337	so in practice e.g. debugging purescript is easier than elm

2020-05-12 17:43:20	countoren	IMO over abstraction can get hard to understand becuase you lose descriptiveness sometimes. for example monads hide logic "in between the lines"
2020-05-12 17:43:51	countoren	but if you know one monad it will be more concise

2020-05-12 17:45:29	lumie1337	the thing to remember is that you can code purescript like elm, but you can't code elm like purescript

2020-05-12 17:45:56	freeman42x	is the stream breaking only for me?
2020-05-12 17:46:03	countoren	but the default is haskell

2020-05-12 17:52:29	lumie1337	its not the same. but you can convert between the too with some adapters.
