2020-04-12 18:03:51	aethuall	why I do this to myself
2020-04-12 18:04:14	aethuall	At least we can do sorta imperative programming by using do notation in haskell
2020-04-12 18:04:20	aethuall	"imperative functional"

2020-04-12 18:05:17	aethuall	me too. It's nice to learn the functional programming concepts, but I'm never going to actually use it for production
2020-04-12 18:05:33	aethuall	I think I'll take a lot of the stuff I learn from it and use it in Rust

2020-04-12 18:06:46	dandymcgee	except C++.. no useful concepts there Kappa
2020-04-12 18:06:54	dandymcgee	j/k j/k there's a few.. or one.
2020-04-12 18:07:02	aethuall	Functional programming through and through is all about reducing code duplication, that's the only reason any of the abstractions like functor, applicative, monad exist, is for reducing code duplication
2020-04-12 18:07:30	dandymcgee	i thought it was about avoiding side effects?
2020-04-12 18:07:42	aethuall	yeah referential transparency is the key point, but
2020-04-12 18:07:57	aethuall	all of the abstractions you make in functional programming are about reducing code duplication

2020-04-12 18:08:11	stropheum	functional programming is all about focusing on business logic as state-agnostic whenever possible
2020-04-12 18:08:15	stropheum	the end result is more reusable code
2020-04-12 18:08:25	-->	ckrpasa (ckrpasa@ckrpasa.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #tek256
2020-04-12 18:08:30	stropheum	i guess state and context agnostic
2020-04-12 18:08:38	dandymcgee	unfortunately real programs need state and side effects
2020-04-12 18:08:47	aethuall	it's more about the "shape" of the problem, rather than the problem itself
2020-04-12 18:09:02	aethuall	I mean, state and side effects are achievable in Haskell through Monads
2020-04-12 18:09:13	aethuall	if by side effects you mean mainly I/O

2020-04-12 18:09:38	dandymcgee	well I/O is the only possible side effect
2020-04-12 18:09:47	dandymcgee	so yeah.. lol

2020-04-12 18:10:34	dandymcgee	unless you're mutating some shared state, but you wouldn't do that in a language where the point is to avoid statefulness

2020-04-12 18:11:42	aethuall	well the State monad exists
2020-04-12 18:11:48	dandymcgee	i thoughts dots was a Unity thing Kappa
2020-04-12 18:11:50	rafaelgss	do work? If yes, where?

2020-04-12 18:12:07	dandymcgee	that was terse LUL

2020-04-12 18:12:31	aethuall	why use lot word when few word do trick

2020-04-12 18:15:40	streamlabs	C forces me to look at each individual part of the game engine, as well as stick to a standard that is relatively portable. Plus I just really enjoy the language.
2020-04-12 18:15:41	dandymcgee	@Tsoding "You will get used to it" is one of the most dangerous sentences ever spoken
